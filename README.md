# Problem Statement

A bank from Europe has been collecting some data from its own customers about their financial habbits. The data was not only restricted to the financials of a customer only. This include other attributes like Age, Location, Gender, Number of products that the customer is using, etc.

For some time now, the bank started observing that the customers have been leaving the bank after staying only 6 months.

We have to figure out what is happening to these custsomers and why are the leaving. Also, we have to figure out if a customer will leave (highest probability of leaving) the bank in the next 6 months, based on the behaviour of the other customers with similar financial features and habbits.
